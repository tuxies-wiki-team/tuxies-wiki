# Tuxie's Wiki

Tuxie's Wiki tries to be a newcomer friendly source of documentation for all things Linux related. From common troubleshooting to cool programs that makes Linux fun, we try to improve Tuxie's Wiki so that it can be a newcomer's "go-to".

## The different series Tuxie's Wiki

### [Linux Guides](https://tuxies-wiki-team.github.io/tuxies-wiki/linux-guides/)

In this series, we offer distro and desktop environment setup guides/tips. If you are fresh installing Linux into your computer, we hope that this series can give you a jumpstart, too!

### [Apps Library](https://tuxies-wiki-team.github.io/tuxies-wiki/linux-apps/)

A collection of apps separated into the "Editor's Choice," "Essentials," "Popular," and "Gnomie" categories worth checking out either they are useful, or fun (or most likely both!).

### [Other Articles](https://tuxies-wiki-team.github.io/tuxies-wiki/guides/)

This is where everything else written by Tuxie's Wiki Team lives ranging from how to make your Firefox scroll to your likings on laptop—to how to how to make your terminal look cooler—to set up your Logitech peripherals to maximize their usability (Logitech Guide coming soon!).
