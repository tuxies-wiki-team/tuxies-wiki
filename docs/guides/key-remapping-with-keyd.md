::: info What is ==keyd?==
`keyd` is a key remapping daemon for Linux that works at the kernel level. `keyd` remaps keys before any application sees them, making it one of the most reliable remapping solutions available on Linux.

This guide walks you through installing keyd from source, writing a basic configuration, and optionally running the setup script to apply a preset configuration and register keyd as an internal keyboard.
:::

## **Prerequisites**

:::warning Before starting, make sure `make` and a C compiler (`cc`) are installed on your system. These are build dependencies required to compile keyd from source.
:::

:::tabs#distro
@tab ::devicon:fedora:: Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install make gcc
```

@tab ::devicon:debian:: Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install make gcc
```

@tab ::devicon:archlinux:: Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S make gcc
```

:::

## **Installing keyd**

`keyd` is not available in most distribution repositories, so it is installed by compiling from its GitHub source.

:::: steps

- **Clone and build**

  Create a directory for your installations and clone the repository into it:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/Installations && cd ~/Installations
  git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd
  cd keyd
  ```

  Then compile and install:

  ```bash
  make && sudo make install
  ```

- **Enable the keyd service**

  keyd runs as a `systemd` service. Enable and start it in one command:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now keyd
  ```

  The `--now` flag both enables the service on boot and starts it immediately. You can verify it is running with:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status keyd
  ```

::::

## **Cofiguring keyd**

keyd reads its configuration from files placed in `/etc/keyd/`. The main configuration file is `/etc/keyd/default.conf`, and it applies to all keyboards by default.

### **Configuration file structure**

A keyd config file has two required sections:

- `[ids]` — Specifies which keyboards the config applies to. Put a `*` to apply to all keyboards.
- `[main]` — Defines your key remappings and layers.

Here is a minimal example that demonstrates common remaps:

:::tabs

@tab /etc/keyd/default.conf

```conf
# Keyd remap Copilot Key to Right Control and Double Shift to CAP
# place in /etc/keyd/

[ids]
*

[main]
capslock = backspace
leftshift+rightshift = capslock
leftshift+leftmeta+f23 = layer(control)
```

:::

| Mapping                                   | What it does                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `capslock = backspace`                    | Remaps Caps Lock to Backspace                                     |
| `leftshift+rightshift = capslock`         | Press both Shifts together to toggle Caps Lock                    |
| `leftshift+leftmeta+f23 = layer(control)` | Remaps a custom key combo (e.g. Copilot key) to act as Right Ctrl |

:::tip
You can find a full list of valid key names in the keyd man page:

```bash
man keyd
```

:::

### Applying a configuration

After writing your config, reload keyd to apply it immediately — no reboot needed:

```bash
sudo keyd reload
```

To verify the config was written correctly:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/keyd/default.conf
```

## Registering keyd as an Internal Keyboard

:::info ==This step is optional for desktops.== It is primarily useful on laptops where you want palm rejection and other libinput heuristics to work with your remapped keyboard.
:::

Create the directory if it does not exist, then write the quirks file:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/libinput
sudo nano /etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks
```

Paste the following content:

:::tabs
@tab /etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks

```conf
# Libinput Local Quirks
# Save as /etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks

[Recognise Keyd as Internal Keyboard]

MatchUdevType=keyboard
MatchName=keyd*keyboard
AttrKeyboardIntegration=internal
```

:::

Save and close the file (`Ctrl`+`O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl`+`X` in nano).
