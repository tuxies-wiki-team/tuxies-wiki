      - title: An entry point to Linux
        icon: 🐧
        details: Linux can be daunting, we try to provide resources to make it easier.
      - title: Beginner-friendly
        icon: ❤️
        details: We have started off this project as new Linux users, so we are very aware in taking that into account. We want newcomers to be able to enjoy Linux just like how we do.
      - title: Explanations as we go
        icon: 📖
        details: We try to write our wiki to be educational so that you can apply the knowledge on your own.
      - title: Detailed documentations
        icon: 📃
        details: We've taken inspiration from the Arch Linux Wiki (which provides a wide array of detailed documentations). We've decided that we'd focus more on the basics and also the fun sides of Linux.
