:::tip Why Fedora?
Fedora is the preferred distro of ==aier==. Fedora offers a high-quality out-of-the-box experience while remaining highly flexible. It is stable, yet it has up-to-date and cutting edge packages.

## **Installation**

::::steps

- **Install Fedora onto your machine**

  :::warning TODO: A video step-by-step installation.

## **Create snapshots/backups** for your computer

We'll be using `btrfs-assistant`, a simple GUI for managing snapshots. It sits on top of `snapper` and uses Fedora's default `BTRFS` filesystem, so snapshots are quick and preserve SELinux labels — no permissive mode and no relabeling needed.

:::tip Prefer the terminal?
Every step below is also available through the `snapper` CLI if you'd rather not use the GUI.
:::

::::steps

- **Install `btrfs-assistant`**

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install btrfs-assistant snapper python3-dnf-plugin-snapper
  ```

- **Set up snapshots**

  Open `btrfs-assistant` and go to the ==Snapper Settings== tab. Click ==New==, set ==Backup path== to `/`, give it a ==Config name==, then click ==Save==.

  With the config selected, tick ==Enable timeline snapshots== and choose how many to keep under ==Snapshot Retention==. Then, under ==systemd Unit Settings==, tick ==Snapper timeline enabled== and ==Snapper cleanup enabled== and click ==Apply systemd changes==.

  :::tip TODO I recommend keeping 3 daily snapshots
  :::

- **Take your first snapshot**

  Switch to the ==Snapper== tab, select your config, and click ==New== to take a manual snapshot. Give it a description like `clean install`.

- **Restore a snapshot when needed**

  On the ==Snapper== tab, open the ==Browse/Restore== view, select the snapshot you want, and click ==Restore==. Reboot once it completes.

  :::note Want to boot straight into a snapshot when your system won't start? [`grub-btrfs`](https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs) adds a snapshots submenu to `GRUB` for exactly that. It has no Fedora package and must be built from source, so follow its README if you'd like to set it up.

## **Further customisation**

From this point on, customisation for your Fedora installation would mainly be based on the DE that you are using.
